# Student-Performance-Prediction
Classify whether a student will pass or fail based on attendance, previous scores, and study habits.
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting student academic performance using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to classify students as either “Pass” or “Fail” based on various features such as study time per week, number of absences, tutoring support, and parental involvement.

Using a logistic regression model, the system achieves high accuracy in predicting outcomes based on these features. The classification model helps educators and institutions proactively identify students who are at risk of failing and allows for timely intervention.

In addition to prediction, the project incorporates K-Means Clustering to group students with similar academic behaviors. These clusters reveal hidden patterns—such as students with low study time and high absences—enabling targeted strategies for improvement.

The project combines both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques and provides valuable insights through visualizations like confusion matrices and cluster plots. Ultimately, this approach enhances decision-making in educational environments by leveraging data to support student success.
